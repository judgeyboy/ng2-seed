# ng2-seed
Angular 2 seeding project with support for Typescript, SystemJS &amp; Jasmine

## Another one!?!?!
I know, I know...another bloody template! There are so many excellent seeding projects to choose from why make another? Well...I've never made one...So I decided to create and share this light-weight seeding project for Angular2 as a starting point for the many Angular2 apps I will be creating in the future. 

I hope it will be useful for someone else too :)

## Installation
    git clone https://github.com/judgeyboy/ng2-seed.git my-awesome-app
